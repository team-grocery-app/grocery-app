# grocery-app

The Grocery App provides the user with the ability to select a recipe(s), view the recipe's ingredients and instructions, select which ingredients the user needs to purchase, and compile a shopping list of the needed items complete with prices.

Front End: Built with HTML5 and CSS3, populated from back-end Java using Thymeleaf and the Spring Framework.  Fully responsive design provides two consistent yet distinct user experiences dependent on device viewport size.
